Welcome to HighPoint Housekeep! This document provides a guide for using the Copilot coding agent within this repository. Please review it before starting work.

## About the Project

HighPoint Housekeep is an Expo Router/React Native application that streamlines housekeeping and maintenance tasks (room selection, requests, checklists, and admin management). The app is built with Expo, React Native, and TypeScript, and uses ESLint for linting.

## Getting Started

To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server with Expo:**

   The interactive Expo dev server lets you choose the target platform.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Helpful platform-specific scripts:

   * **Android (starts Expo dev server targeting Android):**

     ```bash
     npm run android
     ```

   * **Web preview (port 8082):**

     ```bash
     npm run web
     ```

3. **Lint the project:**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

## Deployment

This project does not define a deployment script. Build and distribute the app using Expo tooling (e.g., EAS Build/Submit) or your chosen platform-specific pipeline.
